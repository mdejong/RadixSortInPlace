Optimized implementation of in-place Radix sort.

A rough draft was first implemented in Python and this code was then converted to C++. While many examples of LSD Radix Sort can be found easily, a LSD Radix sort that depends on copying values into a second full size array is not effective for large data sets. An in-place MSD Radix sort requires only minimal memory for count/offset table.
